// pokemon remake react typescript

// self commments: couldn't get the removeFromLocalStorage to remove the pokemon, only added the index number and the name in my favorites DrawerComponent. for some reason, when you favorite the pokemon, it doesn't show in the drawer component until you reload the page. i didn't have enough time to figure out why it does this.
